## Exercise 1.26

> Louis Reasoner is having great difficulty doing exercise 1.24. His fast_is_prime test seems to run more slowly than his is_prime test. Louis calls his friend Eva Lu Ator over to help. When they examine Louis's code, they find that he has rewritten the expmodfunction to use an explicit multiplication, rather than calling square:
>
> ```js
> function expmod(base, exp, m) {
>   return exp === 0
>     ? 1
>     : is_even(exp)
>       ? (expmod(base, exp / 2, m) * expmod(base, exp / 2, m)) % m
>       : (base * expmod(base, exp - 1, m)) % m
> }
> ```
>
> "I don't see what difference that could make," says Louis. "I do." says Eva. "By writing the function like that, you have transformed the Θ(log⁡n)Θ(logn) process into a Θ(n)Θ(n) process." Explain.

## Solution

The expression is evaluated twice at each step
