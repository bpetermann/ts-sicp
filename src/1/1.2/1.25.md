## Exercise

> Alyssa P. Hacker complains that we went to a lot of extra work in writing expmod. After all, she says, since we already know how to compute exponentials, we could have simply written
>
> ```js
> function expmod(base, exp, m) {
>   return fast_expt(base, exp) % m
> }
> ```
>
> Is she correct? Would this function serve as well for our fast prime tester? Explain.

## Solution

It is correct for numbers that do not become too large, then this method would lead to inaccuracies, as the numbers can no longer be represented accurately in JavaScript.
