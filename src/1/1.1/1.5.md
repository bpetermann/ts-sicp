## Exercise 1.5

> Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:
>
> ```js
> function p() {
>   return p()
> }
>
> function test(x, y) {
>   return x === 0 ? 0 : y
> }
> ```
>
> Then he evaluates the statement
>
> ```js
> test(0, p())
> ```
>
> What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer.

## Solution

If the interpreter uses _applicative-order evaluation_, the function and argument expressions would first be evaluated before the resulting function is applied to the resulting arguments. This would lead to an infinite loop.

In _normal-order evaluation_, the arguments would not be evaluated until their values are needed. This would result in a value of 0.
