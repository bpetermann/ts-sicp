## Exercise 1.6

> Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't like the syntax of conditional expressions, involving the characters ? and :. "Why can't I just declare an ordinary conditional function whose application works just like conditional expressions?" she asks.5 Alyssa's friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she declares a conditional function as follows:
>
> ```js
> function conditional(predicate, then_clause, else_clause) {
>   return predicate ? then_clause : else_clause
> }
> ```
>
> Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:
>
> ```js
> conditional(2 === 3, 0, 5)
> ```
>
> Delighted, Alyssa uses conditional to rewrite the square-root program:
>
> ```js
> function sqrt_iter(guess, x) {
>   return conditional(is_good_enough(guess, x), guess, sqrt_iter(improve(guess, x), x))
> }
> ```
>
> What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.

## Solution

The function will be stuck in an infinite loop, because the subexpressions will be evaluated before the resulting function is applied.
