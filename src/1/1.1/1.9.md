## Exercise 1.9

> Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures inc, which increments its argument by 1, and dec, which decrements its argument by 1.
>
> Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating plus(4,5). Are these processes iterative or recursive?

## Solution

The function:

```js
function plus(a, b) {
  return a === 0 ? b : inc(plus(dec(a), b))
}
```

```
plus(4,5)
inc(plus((3), 5))
inc(inc(plus((2), 5)))
inc(inc(inc(plus((1), 5))))
inc(inc(inc(inc(plus((0), 5)))))
inc(inc(inc(inc(5))))
inc(inc(inc(6)))
inc(inc(7))
inc(8)
9
```

... is recursive

The function:

```js
function plus(a, b) {
  return a === 0 ? b : plus(dec(a), inc(b))
}
```

```
plus(4,5)
plus(3,6)
plus(2,7)
plus(1,8)
plus(0,9)
```

... is iterative
