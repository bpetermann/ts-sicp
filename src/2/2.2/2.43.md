## Exercise

> Louis Reasoner is having a terrible time doing exercise 2.42. His queensfunction seems to work, but it runs extremely slowly. (Louis never does manage to wait long enough for it to solve even the 6×66×6 case.) When Louis asks Eva Lu Ator for help, she points out that he has interchanged the order of the nested mappings in the flatmap, writing it as
>
> ```js
> flatmap(
>   (new_row) => map((rest_of_queens) => adjoin_position(new_row, k, rest_of_queens), queen_cols(k - 1)),
>   enumerate_interval(1, board_size)
> )
> ```
>
> Explain why this interchange makes the program run slowly. Estimate how long it will take Louis's program to solve the eight-queens puzzle, assuming that the program in exercise 2.42 solves the puzzle in time TT.
