##Exercise 2.26

> Suppose we define x and y to be two lists:
>
> const x = list(1, 2, 3);
>
> const y = list(4, 5, 6);
>
> What is the result of evaluating each of the following expressions, in box notation and list notation?

## Solution

1. append(x, y) = [1, [2, [3, [4, [5, [6, null]]]]]]

2. pair(x, y) = [[1, [2, [3, null]]], [4, [5, [6, null]]]]

3. list(x, y) = [[1, [2, [3, null]]], [[4, [5, [6, null]]], null]]
