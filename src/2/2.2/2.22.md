## Exercise 2.22

> Louis Reasoner tries to rewrite the first square_listfunction of exercise 2.21 so that it evolves an iterative process:
>
> ```js
> function square_list(items) {
>   function iter(things, answer) {
>     return is_null(things) ? answer : iter(tail(things), pair(square(head(things)), answer))
>   }
>   return iter(items, null)
> }
> ```
>
> Unfortunately, defining square_list this way produces the answer list in the reverse order of the one desired. Why?

## Solution

Because squares are added successively to the front of the answer list via pair.

> Louis then tries to fix his bug by interchanging the arguments to pair:
>
> ```js
> function square_list(items) {
>   function iter(things, answer) {
>     return is_null(things) ? answer : iter(tail(things), pair(answer, square(head(things))))
>   }
>   return iter(items, null)
> }
> ```
>
> This doesn't work either. Explain.

## Solution

Now the whole list is reversed [[[[null, 1], 4], 9], 16]
