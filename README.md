## SICP TS

Repository to accompany me in my study of "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript Edition". The answers to the exercises are written in TS, but are by no means complete, as some questions require an explanation rather than a test.

## ðŸš€ Start

For the `sicp` package you will need node version 16, and yarn

Switch to Node.js v16.16.0 using `nvm`

```js
nvm use
```

Switch to Node.js v16.16.0 using `n`

```js
npm run use-node
```

## ðŸ§ª Tests

The following command executes all Jest test suites

```js
npm run test
```
