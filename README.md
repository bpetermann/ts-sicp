# SICP TS

Repository to accompany me in my study of "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript Edition". The exercise solutions are written as typescript tests, but are by no means complete, as some questions require an explanation rather than a test.

## ðŸš€ Start

For the `sicp` package you will need node version 16, and yarn

```js
nvm use
```

Switch to Node.js v16.16.0 using `n`

```js
npm run use-node
```

2. Start `tsc` in watch mode

```js
npm run watch
```

3. Start nodemon

```js
npm run start
```
